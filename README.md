You can go check their website for more info.

Using this console a Database (either a file database or a sql database) could be manipulated. 
The console has been built with python and the cmd liberary.

<h3> The console </h3>

**create your data model**

**manage (create, update, destroy, etc) objects via a console / command interpreter**

**store and persist objects to a file (JSON file)**

**The first piece is to manipulate a powerful storage system. This storage engine will give us an abstraction between “My object” and “How they are stored and persisted”. This means: from your console code (the command interpreter itself) and from the front-end and RestAPI you will build later, you won’t have to pay attention (take care) of how your objects are stored.**

This abstraction will also allow you to change the type of storage easily without updating all of your codebase.

The console will be a tool to validate this storage engine.
